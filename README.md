# 🧰 My Machine Setup

This repo is my personal guide to setting up:

- 🖥️ macOS dev environment → [`mac/`](./mac)
- 🌐 Ubuntu VPS → [`vps/`](./vps)
- 🐳 Docker services → [`docker/`](./docker)

Each folder has its own step-by-step `README.md`.

## 📁 Structure

- `mac/` – Manual setup steps for macOS
- `vps/` – Manual steps for new VPS/server setup
- `docker/` – Reusable Docker Compose stacks & CLI cheatsheet

## ❗ Private Data

Secrets, keys, and `.env` files are **not stored here**. Use 1Password or encrypted vaults.
